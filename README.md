GreenScan AI is a Python based tool designed to analyze the environmental impact of websites and help developers build more sustainable web applications. The project focuses on estimating website carbon emissions by analyzing page size, media usage and structural elements, while also providing practical optimization suggestions to reduce unnecessary energy consumption.
Unlike common online carbon calculators that only provide single page estimates, GreenScan AI supports multi page website analysis. It crawls internal links, extracts media assets (especially images) and evaluates how design choices such as large decorative images and inefficient loading strategies contribute to higher carbon emissions. The system uses rule based image classification to distinguish between essential and decorative images and estimates emissions based on data transfer size and assumed user traffic.
To make the analysis actionable, GreenScan AI integrates an NLP based recommendation engine that inspects HTML structure and suggests improvements such as image compression, lazy loading, optimized formats and removal of redundant resources. The results are presented through visual charts and automatically generated PDF reports, making it easy to understand the sustainability impact before and after optimization.
The project is intended for students, developers, and researchers interested in green computing, sustainable web design and explainable AI. While the current version relies on heuristic based image analysis, the architecture is designed to support future enhancements such as CNN based image classification, real time traffic analysis and automated optimization.
