#Greenscan AI
GreenScan AI is a website sustainability analyzer designed to measure and reduce the environmental impact of websites. It estimates carbon emissions based on page size, media usage and site structure and provides actionable recommendations to help developers build energy efficient and eco friendly web applications.Greenscan AI is a website sustainability analyzer designed to measure and reduce the environmental impact of  websites. It estimates carbon emissions based on page size, media usage and site structure and provides actionable recommendations to help developers build energy efficient and eco friendly web applications.
The system goes beyond basic carbon calculators by supporting multi page analysis, image impact evaluation and visual sustainability reporting.

##📌Features
**Multi Page Website Crawling** – Scans internal links and analyzes complete websites instead of a single page.
**Image Impact Analysis** – Classifies images as essential or decorative using rule based heuristics.
**Carbon Emission Estimation** – Estimates monthly CO₂ emissions based on page size and traffic assumptions.
**NLP Driven Optimization Suggestions** – Analyzes HTML structure to recommend image compression, lazy loading and removal of redundant assets.
**Before vs After Optimization Comparison** – Shows emission reduction after applying suggested improvements.
**Visual Reports** – Generates charts and downloadable PDF reports for easy interpretation.

##🛠 System Requirements
Standard desktop or laptop system
Minimum 8 GB RAM recommended
Internet connection for website crawling

##💻 Software & Libraries
**Python 3.10+**
**BeautifulSoup** – HTML parsing and crawling
**Requests** – Website content fetching
**Matplotlib** – Data visualization
**FPDF** – PDF report generation
**NLP** techniques for HTML structure analysis

##🔄 Workflow Overview
1.Input a website URL
2.Crawl internal pages and extract media assets
3.Classify images and calculate total page weight
4.Estimate monthly carbon emissions
5.Generate optimization suggestions using NLP
6.Produce visual charts and a sustainability report

##📊 Output
Carbon emission estimates (before & after optimization)
Image classification breakdown
Page size analysis
Optimization recommendations
Downloadable PDF sustainability report
